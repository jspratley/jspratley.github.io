				<p>Greetings!  I'm a student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, studying computer science.  
				My interests in the field primarily involve user interface design and development as I adore the concept of combining computing skills with the creative
				process.</p>
			
				<p>My other pursuits are writing and music.  At the moment I tend to delve more into the fanfiction world, but I
				hope to one day write a novel of my own.  As for music, it's about stress relief and expressing myself.  I am a member of
				the Marching Illini, and I hope to be a flutist for the rest of my life - even if it's just playing for myself at home.</p>
				
				<p>I'm looking for full time positions right now!  My resume is <a href="resume2016.pdf">here</a>.</p>
